\title{Calculate derivatives of CERF for nnGP}
\usage{
compute_deriv_nn(
  w,
  w_obs,
  GPS_m,
  y_obs,
  hyperparam,
  n_neighbor,
  block_size,
  kernel_fn = function(x) exp(-x),
  kernel_deriv_fn = function(x) -exp(-x)
)
}
\arguments{
\item{w}{A scalar of exposure level of interest.}

\item{w_obs}{A vector of observed exposure levels of all samples.}

\item{GPS_m}{An S3 gps object including:
gps: A data.frame of GPS vectors.
- Column 1: GPS
- Column 2: Prediction of exposure for covariate of each data sample
(e_gps_pred).
- Column 3: Standard deviation of  e_gps (e_gps_std)
used_params:
- dnorm_log: TRUE or FLASE}

\item{y_obs}{A vector of observed outcome values.}

\item{hyperparam}{A vector of hyper-parameters in the GP model.}

\item{n_neighbor}{The number of nearest neighbors on one side.}

\item{block_size}{The number of samples included in a computation block. Mainly used to
balance the speed and memory requirement. Larger \code{block_size} is faster, but requires more memory.}

\item{kernel_fn}{The covariance function. The input is the square of Euclidean distance.}

\item{kernel_deriv_fn}{The partial derivative of the covariance function. The input is the square of Euclidean distance.}
}
\value{
A scalar of estimated derivative of CERF at \code{w} in nnGP.
}
\description{
Calculates the posterior mean of the derivative of CERF at a given
exposure level with nnGP.
